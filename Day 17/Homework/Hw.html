    </header>
    <main>
        <p>I just started learning front-end development <br>
        I began with HTML and made my first small web <br>
    pages. It was fun to see how my code turned into something <br>
I could see on the screen. Now I am ready to learn CSS to make my pages <br>
look better and more colorful. I am excited to keep practicing, try new things, and improve my skills <br>
every day</p>
